<h1>Exercise Tracker</h1>

This Python script helps you track your exercises and record them in a Google Sheets document using the Sheety API. It uses the Nutritionix API to identify and log exercises and their nutritional data.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 38.
